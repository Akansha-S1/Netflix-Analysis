Challenges Faced & Solutions:

Variable Naming: Difficulty arose in naming variables consistently and intuitively due to the complexity of the dataset. Overcame by establishing clear naming conventions and documenting them for consistency.

Domain-specific Terminology: Ambiguity in domain-specific terms led to confusion during analysis. Addressed by consulting domain experts and literature to clarify terminology and ensure accurate interpretation.

Ambiguity: Ambiguous data points and interpretations hindered analysis accuracy. Mitigated by conducting thorough data validation and cross-referencing with multiple sources to clarify any discrepancies.

Oversimplification: Risk of oversimplifying complex data structures and relationships during visualization. Managed by using appropriate visualization techniques that accurately represent the complexity of the data without sacrificing clarity.

Need for Accuracy: Ensuring accurate and unbiased visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights. Achieved by rigorously verifying data integrity and employing statistical methods to minimize bias in analysis.
